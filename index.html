<p>Theory</p>
<ol>
    <li>Backbone providers are organizations and businesses that provide access to high-speed data transmission lines and infrastructure to other organizations. These can be considered as a superset of ISPs.</li>
    <li>A client is a user program that connects a server to access a service. A server is software that serves a specific service to its clients.</li>
    <li>Internet servers make the Internet possible. The router communicates between the internet and the devices in your home that connect to the internet. A network switch forwards data packets between devices. Workstations are commonly connected to a local area network and run multi-user operating systems.</li>
    <li>The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.</li>
    <li>Email, network printing, the world wide web.</li>
    <li>Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references to other text that the reader can immediately access.</li>
    <li>The web is the pages you see on your device when you are online. The internet is a network of connected computers that the web works on.</li>
    <li>Through HTTP protocol, resources are exchanged between client devices and servers over the internet.</li>
    <li>HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as html documents. HTTPs is HTTP with encription and verification.</li>
    <li>The first version of the web is reffered to as Web 1.0. Web 2.0 describes the current state of the internet. Web 3.0 is the concept of the next generation of the web, in which most users will be connected via a decentralized network and have access to their own data.</li>
    <li>Web 1.0 was read only. Essentially, you could look up information and read it. Web 2.0 is a dynamic Web that contains non-linear information. Web 3.0 is a current work in progress and the new generation of the World Wide Web.</li>
    <li>Markup languages are sets of directions that tell the browser software how to display and manage a web document.</li>
    <li>Markup languages are used to control the presentation of data. A scripting language is used to differentiate between programs in order to generate data.</li>
    <li>HTML and XML are both descendants of SGML. DHTML is HTML with dynamic functionability. Markdown lets you write a plaintext document that can be post processed into HTML.</li>
    <li>I have a interset in computers, and building them. I have built my own PC in the past, which was a good learning experience for me. I learned where each part went, and what cables plugged into each part.</li>
